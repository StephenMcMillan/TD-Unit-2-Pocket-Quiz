/* The Process:
    - Load the view and create a new quiz manager. (DONE)
    - Quiz Manager can be created with x number of questions. (DONE)
- Quiz set will contain twice the amount of required questions so the likelyhood of repeats is reduced. 
    - View controller will call a fucntion that should serve up a new question at random, remove it from the active question bank and then wait for further response from vc.
    ** It will be up for the view controller to determine how many answers the specific question has.
 
    - View controller can call up with a question and answer, pass out true or false depending on whether question is correct or not.
 
    - Quiz manager will track the score for the current round.
 
    - QuizManager can be reset using a special reset() function so the user can playAgain.
 
 
    How to ensure that each question is random...
    - Select a random index from the questions array.
    - Could have a 'lastQuestion' object which has all the data about the last question that was presented to the user.
    - Last question could be referenced when checking for the correct answer.
